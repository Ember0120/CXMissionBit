		<h1> Hello! Would You play game with me?</h1>
			<h2>   About me:</h2>
		  <p> My name is Ember (Xihan). I am Chinese. Now I am going to Mission high School. </p>
		<p> I never make a game from computer. I really look forward that. That is a special and interesting thing.</p>
		<p> I am really lucky to being this group. I always think computer skill is difficult. Now I am really confident to make my game. My <a href ="www.4399.com"> 4399 </a> is relly good.</p>

	<h3> My goals </h3> 
	<p> This summer I think I can improve my computer skill and make my own game. Share my game to my friends. </p>
